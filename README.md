# Chat App with React and Socket IO

Let's start setting up this app.

## Prerequisites:

Before installing the app, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have Node.js, download and install it.

## Installing the App:

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the chat-app directory.
2.  Run the command `npm install`.
    -   This will install all the Node.js dependencies needed for the app.
3.  After installing Node.js dependencies, go to the client folder.
4.  Inside the client folder, run `npm install` again.
    -   This will install all the React.js dependencies required for the app.
5.  Once React.js dependencies are installed, go back to the main chat-app directory.
6.  Run the command `npm run app`.
    -   This will start both the Node.js and React servers simultaneously.
7.  You can test the app by visiting localhost:3000 in your web browser, where the React App is running.
